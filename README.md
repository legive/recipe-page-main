### What I learned

I learned how important it is to work within containers by applying classes and identifiers to labels to have better control over the design.
Code organization: Using containers, classes and identifiers helps organize and structure your HTML and CSS code in a clearer and more understandable way. This makes it easier to read and maintain, especially on larger projects.

Style Control: By applying classes and identifiers to your HTML elements, you can direct and apply specific styles to those elements using CSS. This gives you precise control over the design and appearance of your web pages.

Style Reuse: By using classes, you can reuse styles across multiple HTML elements that share similar characteristics. This promotes consistency and reduces code duplication in your project.

Flexibility and scalability: By working with containers and classes, your code becomes more flexible and scalable. You can easily adjust the layout and style of your elements without affecting other parts of the website.

Ease of teamwork: Using a consistent methodology for class organization and nomenclature facilitates teamwork. Other developers can quickly understand your code and contribute effectively to the project.

In summary, working within containers and applying classes and identifiers to tags is a fundamental practice in web development that improves organization, style control, code reuse, and team collaboration. It's great that you recognized the importance of these practices! If you have more questions or need more help, don't hesitate to ask!

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my skills in web developing by doing challenges with javascript and reactJS
